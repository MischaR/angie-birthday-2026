                    In the following I created an overview of some milestones of our journey and beautiful memories we

                    we shared that I hold dearly in my heart. I hope you enjoy this little retrospective of your
                    accomplishments and our journey together.

                                embody too. Studying and working hard to become a teacher you already showed how
                                dedicated, resilient and strong you are. Working in a school with kids that you helped
                                and supported in their education and personal growth. When the time came you took the
                                opportunity to start a new chapter in your life and push yourself out of your comfort
                                zone. I am so happy that you did as this made it possible for us to meet.</p>

                                times, more or less 😉. Also you arrived during the pandemic, which made the new life in

                            <p>For our first date we planned to go to <strong>Burg Frankenstein</strong> and we drove
                                there. It was dark, cold, scary... and the restaurant was closed. We made the best of it
                                and decided to go another all-you-can-eat Asian restaurant. During this dinner I was
                                already enticed by your smile and you were totally enticed.. by the food. After that we
                                had a few more dates and I was completely falling for you, and I am still falling for
                                you every day ❤️</p>

                            <p>This was our first trip together and we got to know each other a lot better. During the
                                roadtrip we laughed, we camped, hiked and swam in the beautiful lakes. It was a very
                                basic trip as money was tight back then 🥲. I enjoyed the time so much with you and
                                still remember it as one of my favorite trips we took. I remember rowing on the
                                beautiful lake Bled, hiking in the Austrian woods and camping under the stars.</p>

                            <p>After the basic trip to Slovenia we decided to go for a more luxurious and more romantic
                                wellness trip. We went to a hotel with a spa and a pool and enjoyed the time together.
                                We didn't go to the top of the Zugspitze, but we swam in the cold lake Eibsee and
                                enjoyed the beautiful views. So after having a car again, let's go to Zugspitze!</p>

                                work and coming back again to Germany to the unknown. I still remember how afraid you
                                were and how uncertain everything was. But you kept going and didn't give up. After just
                                2 weeks back in Germany you already accomplished to find a job that we prepared for
                                together. I nearly cried when you send me the message that you got the job and seeing
                                you so happy and proud of yourself was just amazing.</p>

I love that I can rely on you always and that you have my back. Also we went hiking, eating delicious mangos and swimming in the ocean with your noodle. Another highlight was visiting the beautiful old town of Malaga and having a good time with your friend.</p>

                            <p>For celebrating new chapters in our lives together we started the new year in Zurich. Seeing the fireworks at the lake. You just started with your MBA and one of the hardest year was in front of us. We had to balance work, studies and of course our relationship. We knew it would be tough... but we did it!</p>

                            <p>This was our first trip together to Colombia. For me it was amazing to get to know your parents and your family and visiting different places in Colombia. We went to San Andres and Providencia with your parents and enjoyed the beautiful beaches and the landscapes. Also visiting your place in Yopal was really great and enjoyed being there with you and your family.</p>

                            <p>With your MBA program we got the chance to go to Dubai and get to know the city, the culture and the business environment. We visited the Burj Khalifa and the Dubai Mall and enjoyed the beautiful views and the skyline. Also having a drink at the Burj Al Arab was a great experience and going to partying. This trip was quite exhausting because of doing so many things in such a short time. But we made a lot of memories and got to know many new people.</p>

We went to Mexico City and enjoyed the beautiful city, the food and the culture. We flew over the pyramids in a hot air balloon and enjoyed the beautiful views and also going to the crazy big Shakira concert. Also just going to restaurant, eating tacos or having a smoothie is something that I love doing with you.</p>

                            <p>For now our last vacation that we did.. going on a roadtrip by car like 3 years ago in the beginning of our relationship. Listening to music while driving and getting the princess passenger treatment we went to St. Maxime in France. Also this vacation put us to a test in the beginning with a flat completely under water. Despite this tough situation we managed it and enjoyed some sunny days at the Côte d'Azur, taking in the last sun rays of the year in St. Tropez and Nice and enjoying the French cuisine.</p>
